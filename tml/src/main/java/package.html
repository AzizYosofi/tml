TML (Text Mining Library) is a general purpose Text Mining library which purpose is to support the development of educational applications by providing TM functionalities (For a quick start please start in <a href="au/edu/usyd/glosser/tml/storage/Repository.html">Repository</a>).

<h2>TML design principles</h2>

<p>The Storage and Corpus packages implement the storing of documents in a repository, and searching the repository to form a corpus. The Vectorspace package implements the transformation of a corpus into a VSM representation, and the use of this model with data mining algorithms. The Utils package contains those routines that are required for specific processes, not directly related with the TM process (e.g. grammar parsing and matrix operations). Finally, a Configuration class allows TML to process Java properties files to read default parameters for its operation.</p>
<p>Please read each package documentation for examples.</p>
